              <span class= "title">Flower power brings Christmas joy in July: </span> Every employee, from doctor to janitor to cafeteria worker, of Brooklyn's Interfaith Medical Center now owns an original Michael Gittes. When the pandemic was at its worst in the US, Los Angeles-based Gittes decided to create and gift an original painting to every employee of a hospital in New York, then the worst-hit state. Gittes picked Interfaith as it met his specifications for the perfect hospital for his donation, including that it was a non-profit hospital operating in an underserved community. 
              <br>
              <br>
              To pay homage to the hospital staff, the artist created 1,800 acrylic paintings, each representing a flower. Every painting in the "Strangers to No One" project was created using syringes. "In both cases, they are employing a syringe to help others heal," Gittes' manager said. 
              <br>
              <br>
              To the Interfaith staff, this was the artist's message: "You're loved by millions of people you'll never meet. You're not a stranger to anyone. And these flowers are from everyone." 
              <br>
              <br>
              Says Interfaith CFO Tracy Green of her staff's reaction when they received the paintings: "It was <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/19/us/los-angeles-artist-donates-paintings-hospital-brooklyn-trnd/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">like Christmas</a>."

Have 4 kids: </span> Hungary has devised a plan to boost its dwindling numbers, but it's a plan that will benefit only the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hungary-paying-citizens-to-have-babies-60-minutes-2020-07-19/" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">right kind of Hungarian</a>, CBS' 60 Minutes says. With a population count of less than 10 million and falling, the Central European country under Prime Minister Viktor Orban in 2019 unveiled the Family Protection Action Plan – a $2.5 billion program aimed at improving the country's birthrate.
              <br>
              <br>
              The plan offers families cash, loans and even subsidies to buy a minivan if they procreate. Just promising to have one child gets the couple a $30,000 loan. Rates are cut after two children and forgiven after three. If the couple can commit to at least four kids, the woman is exempted from paying income tax for life.
              <br>
              <br>
              In a country that under Orban erected a $500 million fence along its border with Serbia and that the prime minister describes as an "illiberal democracy," strict eligibility criteria need to be met to benefit from the plan. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The couple must have enough savings of their own to be eligible; those who are gay, divorced, or not married are excluded.
              <br>
              <br>
              "We must state that we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed," Orban said in a speech last year.
              <br>
              <br>
              Needless to say, only Hungarians need apply.

For polar bears, their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/climate/polar-bear-extinction.html#:~:text=Superstock%2C%20via%20Alamy-,Global%20Warming%20Is%20Driving%20Polar%20Bears%20Toward%20Extinction%2C%20Researchers%20Say,change%20continues%20unabated%2C%20scientists%20said." style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">main habitat</a> is sea ice where they live and hunt for food, a loss of sea ice would force them onto land and they would eventually starve. "There's not enough food on land to sustain a polar bear population," Peter Molnar, the lead author of the study, said.

              <span class= "title">One giant leap for (wo)mankind: </span> Sudan has given back its women a basic human right. On Saturday, Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari announced that the country is banning female genital mutilation, a barbaric practice that leads to lifelong physical and psychological trauma for the woman. In another hurrah for women's rights, the north African country will no longer require women to obtain permission from a male member of the family to travel with her children. And, in another reversal of almost 40 years of hardline Islamist policies, non-Muslims, some 3% of the country's population, will be allowed to consume alcohol in private. Drinking is still prohibited for Muslims, with flogging the punishment meted out to offenders. However, apostasy will no longer be treated as a criminal act, leaving Muslims in the country free to convert if they so choose. In 1983, the country's then president, Jaafar Nimeiri, introduced Islamic law and banned alcohol, throwing bottles of whiskey into the Nile as a symbolic gesture. When the autocrat Omar al-Bashir came to power in 1989, he strengthened Islamic law, further restricting citizens' freedoms. In 2019, after 30 years at the helm, Bashir was overthrown and the new transition government, led by Abdalla Hamdok, promised to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-politics/sudan-to-allow-drinking-alcohol-for-non-muslims-ban-fgm-idUSKCN24D0EH" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">bring democracy</a> to the country.

              <span class= "title">What once was repulsive, is now all good: </span> Although Pakistan has come down hard on acid attacks and the country's new legislation imposes hefty fines and long prison terms on offenders, women in the South Asian country often still fall victim to the heinous crime. Scarred and disfigured, these women find it hard to survive in a society that rejects them and treats them as outcasts. Pakistani businesswoman Masarrat Misbah has sought to mitigate that situation. In 1980, she launched Depilex – a salon that would become a haven for victims of acid attacks – and 25 years later she set up the Depilex Smileagain Foundation. Over the years, several battered women have found their way to Depilex, where they are offered counselling, reconstructive surgery, vocational training and jobs. Margaret Heera is one such survivor. In 2013, after two years of marriage, her husband, unhappy about the small dowry she brought him, poured acid on her. Today Heera is a beautician at Depilex's Lahore branch. She says that although clients at first were "shocked" when they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/14/now-im-independent-the-pakistan-beauty-salons-employing-acid-attack-survivors" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">saw her scars</a> and refused to allow her to work for them, perspectives eventually changed and things are "all good" now.

They also went on to earn the ire of many of their Indian fans for using an idol of Lord Ganesha in the video. The use of the statue of the elephant-headed Hindu god, placed on the ground next to an Aladdin lamp, in the single "How You Like That" has drawn criticism from fans, with many accusing the all-girl Korean band of cultural appropriation and of defiling the idol by placing it on the ground. Blackpink were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/world/asia/blackpink-ganesha-kpop-cultural-appropriation.html" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">quick to respond</a> and Ganesha was soon gone from the video.

                <span class= "title">This Bud's for Brahma.</span> Unlike Blackpink and their disappearing Ganesha, Anheuser-Busch is taking a tougher stance. A group comprising representatives of the Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu and Jain faiths recently called on the Belgium-based brewer to rename its Brahma line of beers, brewed and loved in Brazil since 1888. In the words of group spokesperson Rajan Zed, Brahma, the three-headed Hindu god, is not meant to be a "toasting tool" and Anheuser-Busch should just call the beer by another name. However, the makers of Budweiser begged to differ, with a company representative noting that while Hindus are a tiny minority in Brazil, the Brahma brand is "very important to the culture of the country." He did clarify though that the beers were named after Englishman Joseph Bramah, who is credited with inventing the draft pump valve, and not in honor of the Hindu god, who is credited with creating the world. To make the name work better in Portuguese, the <a href="https://apnews.com/be4707da1197956a846333fb4281b6b8" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">spelling was changed</a> from Bramah to Brahma. We're staying non-controversial (a rose by any other name and so on) and toasting with Budweiser.

With many more turtles entangled in the waste, locals worked frenetically to free them and release them back into the sea. According to Bangladesh's forestry department, never before has such a large quantity of plastic washed ashore the 120-km beach along the Bay of Bengal.

The Royal Collection Trust this week launched a small-batch London dry gin made with 12 botanicals, several of which come from the Queen's garden. Here's the recipe from the sellers: "For the perfect thirst-quencher, the recommended serving method is to pour a measure of the gin into an ice-filled short tumbler before topping up with tonic and garnishing with a slice of lemon." Each 700 ml bottle of <a href="https://www.rct.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/official-buckingham-palace-gin-goes-on-sale#/" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">Buckingham Palace gin</a> is priced at £40, a bargain given that this is the stuff that's going to be served at official Palace events.

                  <span class= "title">Homeward bound on a brand-new bicycle: </span>  When the coronavirus sent Europe into lockdown, University of Aberdeen student Kleon Papadimitriou realized he wasn't going to be able to get a flight back home to Athens. By the first of April, most of his friends had left and Papadimitriou wasn't exactly excited at the prospect of having to spend the next month or more in quarantine in Scotland. That's when the idea of biking the 4,000-odd kms between Scotland and Greece began to take shape and on May 10, a journey that was initially just a "pipe dream," formally kicked off. Armed with a sleeping bag, canned food, peanut butter and bread, the 20-year-old set off on his new bike for home. Most nights of his 48-day journey were spent camping in fields and forests, although the prospect of a bed and hot shower did occasionally push the introverted Papadimitriou to seek out friends and acquaintances along the way. "You will learn things about yourself and you <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/greek-college-student-bikes-home-48-days-trnd/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">will surprise yourself</a>," is what Papadimitriou had to say of the experience.

                  <span class= "title">Google's very own Rosetta stone:</span>  Google this week launched Fabricius, a hieroglyphics translator that uses Artificial Intelligence to decode ancient languages. The feature, added to Google's Arts & Culture app, allows users to convert their words and emojis into <a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/fabricius/en" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">shareable hieroglyphs</a>. But Fabricius is much more than a new fun way to chat with friends, it's also for the serious student of Egyptology. Users can upload pictures of real hieroglyphs onto the software's Workbench tool, which can then be used to digitally enhance the images to allow for closer analysis. Users can also trace an outline of hieroglyphics and use the software's database and machine learning capabilities to attempt to decipher it. The tech giant is hopeful that the more people use the tool, the more extensive and refined its database will become.

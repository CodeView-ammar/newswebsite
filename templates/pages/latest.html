Hagia Sophia was built in the sixth century during the Christian Byzantine Empire and served as the seat of the Greek Orthodox Church. When the Ottomans conquered Istanbul in the 15th century, the cathedral was immediately converted into a mosque. In 1935, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, to proclaim Turkey's secular nature to the world, turned the monument into a museum. On Thursday, the country's highest administrative court heard a case challenging the legality of Ataturk's move.
                                          Although there have long been calls to convert the UNESCO World Heritage site back into a mosque to better reflect the country's identity as a Muslim majority, this is the first time the issue has proceeded so far. In a letter to UNESCO, Greece's culture minister said Erdogan's plan "rekindles national and religious fanaticism." US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has angered Ankara with his statement that the monument is better left alone as a museum. The court will give its <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/turkeys-top-administrative-court-completes-hearing-on-status-of-hagia-sophia/news" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">verdict</a> within 15 days.

In mid-May about a dozen elephants were reported dead; by the end of the month it was 169. That figure has now crossed 350, with conservationists warning the number is likely to be higher as carcasses can be difficult to spot in an aerial survey. Experts say more are likely to die, with live elephants appearing weak and shrunken and seen walking around in circles, an indication of neurological impairment. Samples have not yet been tested so it's not known what is causing the mass deaths. As tusks of the dead elephants have not been taken, poachers are being ruled out. Anthrax was initially considered the most likely cause but that has also been ruled out. Conservationists are concerned at Botswana's lack of urgency in getting the samples tested. "It's a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/more-than-350-elephants-dead-in-mysterious-mass-die-off-botswana-aoe" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">conservation disaster</a> – it speaks of a country that is failing to protect its most valuable resource," said Niall McCann, director of conservation at National Park Rescue, a UK-based charity. Between 10% and 12% of Botswana's GDP is attributable to ecotourism, only diamonds contribute more.

                                            Little did Lenin Gutierrez know that a simple question about a mask would raise such hell. On Monday, the Starbucks barista found himself at the receiving end of a diatribe when he inquired of a customer if she had a mask, something Starbucks requires its customers to wear. Amber Lynn Gilles' fury did not subside with the insults she hurled at him at the store; she later took to Facebook to vent further. In what one can only assume is to her utter dismay, her comments section was flooded with support for the barista, with some remarking that they wished they could give Gutierrez a tip. So Matt Cowan decided to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/28/us/starbucks-barista-mask-amber-lynn-gilles-trnd/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">facilitate</a> just that. Upset that Gutierrez was "being bullied for doing the right thing," Cowan set up a GoFundMe so that those who wanted to tip the barista could do so. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/tips-for-lenen-standing-up-to-a-san-diego-karen?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&fbclid=IwAR2sEnAtNcYLUdolydivjCAgWtwAH9my7juGfqJYbAi83GxR0cGY8ySORpM" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">Contributions</a> have crossed $100,000.

                                            Unfortunately, a similar request to wear a mask did not stop at verbal abuses but got physical in India's Andhra Pradesh. When a colleague reminded him to wear a mask as part of India's coronavirus regulations, C Bhaskar, a senior state tourism department employee, abused, insulted and physically assaulted his female colleague. The police <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/told-to-wear-a-mask-andhra-govt-official-assaults-woman-arrested/story-x447ZyzvuRvpcKG7ZLfEPI.html" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">complaint</a> against him reads that he "dragged her from her chair, caught hold of her hair and started beating her on her face and head with a stick pulled out from a wooden chair."

According to Italian regulations, bears that attack humans must be euthanized. Still, as DNA evidence is being gathered to identify the bear, animal rights groups are calling for a stay of the culling order at least until an investigation is carried out and more details emerge as to what led to the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/27/world/bear-sentenced-to-death-in-italy-scli-intl/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">attack</a>.

When Mao lost her appetite after her mate died, staff put her on a high-calorie diet in an attempt to maintain her weight. But it's more than maintain she did, she piled on quite a few extra pounds as well. Now officials are taking the help of visitors to the zoo to get her back in shape. Visitors are encouraging Mao to get moving and make the 60-meter journey to the fence of her enclosure by tempting her with bananas and apples. Once she attains her <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/30/national/elephant-diet-morioka-zoo/#.XvsnDJMzaNY" style="text-decoration: none;color:rgb(32, 133, 140) ">ideal weight</a>, experts want to artificially inseminate her. A success story would mean Japan's first baby elephant born through artificial insemination. We're keeping our fingers crossed.
